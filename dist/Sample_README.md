  ## Description 

  Portfolio-generator is a project that have worked on as part of a collaborative effort with Columbia engineering coding boot camp. This app is designed to effectively generate a professional portfolio template based on the users answers about the projects associated with GitHub. Using inquirer and node.js this project was designed to help the user create a great portfolio. In this app users will create a fully styled HTML document that can always be re-worked to fit an individual need but is ready made for a simple yet elegant showcasing of your hard work.

  ## *Installation*

  This app was created using primarily JavaScript and Node.js. Due to this factor, it is not currently deployable to work in the browser and can’t be deployed to a live page. So instead to run this app you will have to install it onto your local computer from the project repo page which I have linked in the description section. Once downloaded you will need to also make sure you have Node.js installed to run the app in your computer’s terminal. It is recommended to get the latest version from their website.

  ## Usage 

  To begin open your terminal, if you have git bash you can use that, and change into the root directory containing the downloaded repo files. Once in the directory you can load the project by typing in “node app.js” and you should see questions appear in your terminal. When prompted with each question answer each one as accurately as possible, because the answers you provide will be filtered into portfolio generator page. Once finished the portfolio page template will be generated and saved in the dist/ folder found in the root of the downloaded files. You can view the file in vs code or online in your GitHub repo.

  ## Contribution

  The rules for contributing to this app are very simple and are as follows. Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others, and respect each other boundaries. Give constructive feedback and accept it as well. Focus on fixing the project and not on fixing just an individual. Most importantly no harassment, will be tolerated, and will get you swiftly removed from the community. Otherwise commit each change and wait for approval from the repo owner to have changes added. Keep issues short and concise then have fun adding to a great project.

  ## Tests

  Some quick and easy tests to run is to look on the web and find a different CSS library to link to the project. You can download the files onto the system as a separate files sheet, which will then need to be added to the “copyFile()” function found on the generate-site.js page in the utils folder, and the page-template.js page in the src/ folder to change some of the class selectors to fit. Have fun and create a cool looking page that you can then deploy as a custom portfolio page.*Note: the src folder is where you should also download the new CSS stylesheet into if you should choose to go that route*
