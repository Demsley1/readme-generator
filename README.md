## Description 

This project is dedicated to producing this; a quality readme. In creating multiple readme.md files for my project repos I have now gained enough experience in coding to design an app that will allow any user to generate a quailty readme while only answering a few simple questions. Throughout the designing of the app I have come to learn many skills and used new programs and features, that will not only hlp me improve in my coding, but also improve the apps i have previously worked on by myself, as well as with others.

## Installation

This project was created using only javascript and node command functions. Due to this fact to run this app it is recommended you download the files from the linked github repostory. [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Demsley1/readme-generator). Once downloaded if their is not already one in the file directory you downloaded, in the root folder of the files create a new folder with name 'dist'. 

## Usage

Once all the files are on your local computer then you should be basically ready to run the app. Make sure you have nod.js installed, then in your computers terminal intiate the app by typing 'node index.js' into the command line. Then answer all questions to the best of your ability as most questions answers will be used for each portion of the readme, and will be neccessary for users to learn about your project and how to communicate with you. 

## Credits 

This app was created by me Denva Emsley, for use in the columbia Engineering Coding Bootcamp. 

Here is a link to a repo that details how you should design a professional readme that i also used to assist me in creating my own project: [readme-guide](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma/blob/main/readme-guide.md)

## Screenshots 

Here are some Screenshots of an example readme generated from this app. 


Here is a link to a video demonstration file for the readme-generator app.
